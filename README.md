# 👋 Hey there! It's Hardi
A Software Engineer on a mission to transform complex challenges into smooth, efficient solutions. My toolkit? It’s loaded with front-end magic (hello, Angular) and back-end power (Java and .NET, though I’m flexible and quick to adapt to new tech). With a strong foundation in database expertise, I’m all about keeping things running seamlessly and scaling them to new heights. 🚀

📚 Languages & Frameworks: Fluent in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, and C# — well-versed in Angular, .NET, Spring Boot, and skilled with data visualization tools that make data sparkle. ✨

💡 About Me:

I’m a lifelong learner, diving into HackerRank and LeetCode to keep my problem-solving on point and my mind sharp. 🧠

Data visualization and UI/UX optimization are my sweet spots — I love making data intuitive with tools like Highcharts and AG-Grid to create effortless user experiences. 🎨📊

I’m currently exploring full-stack development in-depth and excited about contributing to open-source projects while expanding my tech stack.
